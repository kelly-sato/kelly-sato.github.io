In Spring 2019, I participated in Mililani High School's Rocketry club where we worked on a rocket for The American Rocketry Challenge (TARC). We were tasked to design a rocket of certain specifications that would reach apogee within a specific range, complete its flight within a certain time, while holding and protecting the payload---an approximately 50 gram egg.

I used Autodesk's Inventor to design the rocket's nose cone, fins, and air brakes. We did several static tests and one dynamic test using these parts, but were unable to qualify as we were unable to get an NAR flight observer to observe our rocket's flight.

Overall, it was a good experience to designing an amateur rocket with custom parts, and I was able to develop proficiency in Inventor and gained experience in mechanical drafting.
