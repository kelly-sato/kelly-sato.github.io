In Spring 2019, I participated in Mililani High School's Rocketry club where we worked on a rocket for The American Rocketry Challenge (TARC). We were tasked to design a rocket of certain specifications that would reach apogee within a specific range, complete its flight within a certain time, while holding and protecting the payload---an approximately 50 gram egg.

I used AutoCAD and Inventor to design the rocket's nose cone, fins, and air brakes. We did several static tests using these parts, the results of which I used to refine the designs for a dynamic test. Ultimately, we were unable to qualify as we were unable to get an NAR flight observer to observe our rocket's flight.

Overall, it was a good experience for designing an amateur rocket with custom parts, and I was able to develop proficiency in Inventor and AutoCAD, and gained experience in mechanical drafting.
