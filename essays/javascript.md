## Ask and you shall receive

Ever since I was little, I was a very crafty person---I would make my own Halloween costumes, knit my own beanies, crochet leis, and more. So, of course, my family and friends would ask me to make them things, and I would usually do it. For me, I am most in my element working with my hands, so learning to code was challenging, but I did it. I was successful with the majority of the ICS 111 and 211 homeworks, and I even got A's in both classes! 

So, those skills should transfer over into real life, right? _...Right?_

### It wasn't an unreasonable ask... In fact, it was pretty reasonable

Ever since YouTube struck down music bots like Rhythm and Groovy, many of us Discord users were left without a way to stream music to voice chats. Naturally, my boyfriend asked me, "You know how to code, right? So, can you make a music bot for me and my friends' server?"

"Oh, of course! That should be no problem," I naively agreed. "I already know Java, so I basically already know JavaScript! I'll get it to you by your birthday!"

**Now I had a deadline.**

### How I failed

Well, _no_, the coding wasn't a problem, and I picked up the basics quickly. But not really. I've never developed any sort of software before, much less worked in JavaScript, so in a way, everything was familiar but _foreign_. I quickly got over the fact that JavaScript wasn't typed, in fact, I loved it, and it made me more confident that I'd be able to get this done in time---but at the same time, I had no idea what a function was, nor an anonymous function, and don't get me started on promises! So, I looked to the Internet for help. Why were the people in the YouTube videos writing their functions in all these different ways? Does it matter? What's the difference?

Somehow, I managed to deploy the bot, so it appears online in the Discord server! ...doing nothing... 

Let's just say, my boyfriend got a very nice custom embroidered shirt for his birthday, and not a functioning music bot.

## Lessons

Luckily for me, I'm taking ICS 314 and we had to run through a JavaScript tutorial which immediately cleared a lot of things up for me. There are multiple ways to define a function! Anonymous functions are functions without names that aren't stored and can be called anonymously! Promises are literally promises that an asynchronous task will eventually be resolved or rejected! ...I think. Although I am still new to JavaScript and will definitely need more exposure to these things in practice to really nail down what they mean, so far, I am _loving_ JavaScript. It's hard to describe, but JavaScript just feels so versatile and powerful in the things that it can do, and it feels a lot less tedious than Java. For example, in JavaScript, you don't have to write a main method or class declarations in order for you to run your code. For building web apps, JavaScript seems to be very powerful, and I can see why it's so popular.

Prior to taking ICS 314, I had no idea about the Athletic Software Engineering (ASE) pedagogy. I thought that trying to make that bot in a week was fast! However, I believe that ASE will prove to be a great tool to train myself to make good, quick decisions and force myself to problem solve in a timed, _sterile_ environment. I understand that we are allowed to use ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot in this course, but I do not plan on using either so that I have more reason to actually learn and internalize the material. So far, the WODs have been fun, and I enjoy being put in a timed environment. Even if ASE does not make me a better programmer, it will make me a better decision maker under pressure by the end of the semester.

So, my ICS 314 career will be over in December (assuming I don't flunk out, God forbid), which means that I will have gained experience and knowledge in software engineering just in time for Christmas... And that music bot still needs to be made...

**Now I have a deadline.**
