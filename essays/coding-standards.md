Growing up wanting to be an engineer, my father told me again and again that my messy handwriting was not going to cut it. He said that in engineering, good handwriting was important for your notes, your plans, your professor... And though I am not in engineering, it remains a fact that in fields that deal with precise numbers, precise _code_, **legibility is invaluable.**

Having messy code is the same as having bad handwriting---maybe _you_ can read it, but what about everyone else? Luckily, it's easier to change how you write code than it is to give your handwriting an overhaul with the help of coding standards!

## Consistency is legibility

Coding standards like ESLint provide us with "rules" to follow to help us to write legible code. You could argue that these rules are arbitrary guidelines that don't change the functionality of the code at all, and you would be right. Then, why does it matter whether or not we stick to these rules?

### Having standards affects comprehension

You are working on a group essay. You decide to write with Times New Roman, 12 point font, double spaced. However, one of your group mates decides to use 11 point font, single spaced. Then, another group mate doesn't indent any of their paragraphs. The essay is well-organized, flows well, and has no grammatical errors---but that doesn't make it more legible. 

In psychology, there is something called the switch cost effect, in which switching from one task to another causes mental fatigue and lack of concentration, ultimately reducing task performance. If someone has to switch from trying to understand what some code is doing to trying to mentally reformat it, I argue that this may be a task switch that is detrimental to the actual code comprehension.

In other words, at best, coding without coding standards is, at best, distracting and a minor inconvenience. At worst, it inhibits comprehension of the content, wasting time (and potentially, money).

In the real world, engineers work together on projects, which means that not only _you_ need to understand what you wrote. Other people are going to need to read, and potentially build off of your notes, your plans, and _your code_. If you make your teammates rely on you to explain everything that you already wrote, you're doing something wrong. In any type of engineering, it is an unnecessary risk to be sloppy.

Finally, let's say you have a personal project that you might want to update in the future. Well, _future you_ might get a headache trying to read _current you's_ code! Just make life easy and stick to some coding standards!

## ESLint and  IntelliJ

Using ESLint in IntelliJ has shown me that I still have to work on writing legible code. All too often will warnings and errors pop up, and I have to make those adjustments. Luckily, IntelliJ tells you exactly what needs to be fixed and with the click of a button, will automatically fix the issue for you. I don't make many significant errors, mostly forgetting spaces and dropping the occasional semicolon, but I find the green checkmark to be very helpful and validating that, hey, I wrote legible code!

So, while it may be tedious to learn coding standards and apply them, I can attest to the fact that it has enhanced my code's clarity and has helped me to debug code more quickly. Legibility leads to comprehension, and comprehension leads to easy maintenance and improvement of code. The less complex, the better.
