## "The only stupid question is the one you didn't ask"

This is a phrase I have heard many professors say to make students feel less embarrassed to ask questions in class, espcially in front of their peers. And yes, it's better to ask a question than not to, and in my college experience so far, I have had the fortune of hearing almost exclusively "smart" questions---in Computer Science, those are generally questions that provide relevant context of the problem, symptoms of the problem, and why that problem is stopping the asker from getting to their goal, among other things. That being said, I'd like to petition that the above phrase be changed to "the only stupid question is the one you should be ashamed to have asked." However, I admit it's not nearly as inviting to people who are genuinely apprehensive to ask for help, and it's not exactly appropriate for a professor or even other students to publicly shame someone for asking a stupid question.

Fortunately, we have the Internet to do that!

Approximately 9 hours ago as of writing, [Karim Gaber proposes that we have a candy store, and a box of 2*n candies.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77061160/candy-store-problem-solving-coding-challenge) Flavors are represented by a numeric value and, given an array of different flavors, we must arrange the flavors into matching pairs, e.g. [5, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8] should be divided into three pairs, (5, 5), (8, 8), and (8, 8). **Tell me how to do it.**

Um. No, Karim. **Nobody's gonna do your homework for you.** Though, Karim has well exemplified a _not_-very-smart question.

### How could Karim have improved this question?

If you went to read Karim's original message, you can see it's a mess that looks like it was copy-pasted off of his course's webpage, broken formatting and all. Like I said, nobody's gonna do his homework for him, but also, it isn't really legible at first glance which is an immediate downvote and leave for the other 11 viewers of his post. 

However, let's say that Karim attempted his homework, and ran into some problem pairing up
