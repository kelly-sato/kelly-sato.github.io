When I did the "Browser History" homework WODs, I was underwhelmed by the result. It was a lot of work for a _really_ ugly product. 

Maybe it's the color combination and the blue hyperlinks, but it looks like an early 2000's website. It looks like it's trying to steal my personal information. It looks like my browser is going to _strongly_ advise me to leave this site. It scares me. But what scares me more is _how much work_ I put into it for it to come out looking like _that_. How was I ever going to make a beautiful UI if I was struggling to make an ugly one?

## What makes UI Frameworks so useful?

In ICS 314, the UI Framework we used is Bootstrap. Bootstrap has a grid system that allows us to create responsive rows and columns. For my purposes, it has been an absolute game changer, turning what would have been a 20 minute fight with CSS to create columns into a trivial task. It has allowed me to create clean, modern-looking UIs, such as this recreation of the <a href="https://independentenergyhawaii.com">Independent Energy</a> about page.

<div class="p-4">
    <img style="float: left" width="500px" src="../img/ie-cropped.png" class="img-thumbnail px-4"  alt="your-choice">
    
</div>

Bootstrap makes life good. Without it, creating a nice-looking _anything_ is nearly impossible.
