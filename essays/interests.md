## I was an ME major... for a semester

When I entered middle school, I knew what I wanted to do with my life: I was going to be an engineer. I loved watching fabrication videos, learning about how things were made and how things worked... I still do! However, when I entered university for Mechanical Engineering---something I had waited my whole life to do---I knew it wasn't for me.

Over the previous summer, I took Mark Rober's online class on the engineering design process. We were tasked to build one mechanical project, one electrical project, and one that combined the two. I really only enjoyed coding the Arduino for the electrical project. It was a bit of a rude awakening to the fact that if I became an engineer, _no_, I wouldn't be spending my time designing passion projects. After one semester, I switched my major to Computer Science with almost no other coding experience than some basic C++ on that Arduino project.

## What I find interesting about Computer Science

I switched to Computer Science because I have always been curious about how computers worked, especially how the many softwares I used worked. Although I ultimately plan to go into cybersecurity, I believe Software Engineering will be able to itch that scratch of making what _I_ want.

### My interests in Software Engineering

For Software Engineering, I am interested in learning how to create a user-friendly interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Whenever I use an application, the first thing I notice is whether or not it is easy to use---not the learning curve of the actual application, but more so if it is easy to navigate. For example, AutoCAD has a learning curve to effectively use the software, but if you let someone play with it for 30 minutes, they'd likely be able to grasp some basic skills of the program: how to draw a line, toggle the grid on/off, measure distances, etc. Although I doubt I'll be making AutoCAD level software anytime soon, I want to make the experience of my application as pain-free as possible.

I also hope to improve my JavaScript skills. Over the summer, I tried (and failed) to make a Discord bot using JavaScript. Well, "failed" is the wrong word---rather, I created a much less useful bot than I had intended. What was intended to be a music bot that could play songs from YouTube links ended up only being able to send a pre-programmed message when the command was entered. I _did_ speed through some basic JavaScript tutorials on YouTube, but did not come away with any substantial knowledge. I hope to change that by the end of the semester, and feel that I am already making progress after jamming out the FreeCodeCamp assignments.

Finally, I want to add more projects to my portfolio. Because I am relatively new to coding in comparison to many of my peers, I have pretty much zero coding projects, and the ones that I do have are as basic as basic gets. I'd like to change that this semester as my coding skills grow, and continue to create software well into the future, whether it be for my friends or for myself.

Although I may have started out wanting to become a Mechanical Engineer, my biggest goal this semester is ultimately to become a Software Engineer, and to grow my understanding of what duties that entails.
