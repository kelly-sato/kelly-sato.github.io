## I was an ME major... for a semester

When I entered middle school, I knew what I wanted to do with my life: I was going to be an engineer. I loved watching fabrication videos, learning about how things were made, and how things worked---I still do. However, when I entered university for Mechanical Engineering, something I had waited my whole life to do, I knew it wasn't for me.

Over the previous summer, I took Mark Rober's online class on the engineering desing process. We were tasked to build one mechanical project, one electrical project, and one that combined the two. I really only enjoyed coding the Arduino for the electrical project. It was a bit of a rude awakening that if I became an engineer, _no_, I won't be spending my time designing and fabricating whatever _I_ want. After one semester, I switched my major to Computer Science with almost no other coding experience than some basic C++ on that Arduino project.

## What I find interesting about Computer Science

I switched to Computer Science because I have always been curious about how computers worked, especially how the many softwares I used worked. Although I ultimately plan to go into cybersecurity, I believe Software Engineering will be able to itch that scratch of making what _I_ want.

### My interests in Software Engineering

For Software Engineering, I am interested in learning how to create a user-friendly interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
